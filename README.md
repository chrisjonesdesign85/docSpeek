# About DocSpeek

Hello, my name is Chris, and I'm excited to introduce you to my new app. The app is written in modern Javascript, and it allows you to convert PDFs to speech using state of the art voice modeling technology.

# How it Works

The app is simple and easy to use. All you need to do is upload your PDF file, and the app will use the web speech API to synthesize the text into speech. You can then listen to the audio output or download it as an MP3 file.

# Benefits

This app is perfect for anyone who wants to listen to their PDFs instead of reading them. It's great for people who are on the go, have reading difficulties, or just prefer to listen to their content.

# Technology Used

The app uses modern Javascript and the web speech API to synthesize the text into speech. The voice modeling technology used in the app is state of the art, which ensures that the audio output is of high quality and easy to understand.

# Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read about my app. I hope that you find it useful and enjoyable to use. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
